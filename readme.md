# README - Request Analysis Script

This README document is designed to guide you through the results interpretation of the Request Analysis Script. The main goal of this script is to identify whether there is a linear relationship between the number of parameters in a request (cloud_ids_cnt) and the execution time (time).

## Overview
The script analyses data from a CSV file, applying statistical methods such as Pearson's correlation and linear regression, and visualizes these relationships using scatter plots and trend lines. Here's how to understand and interpret the results produced by this script.

## File Description
- CSV Input File: This file should contain the data with the following columns: id, cloud_ids_cnt, time, and failed.
- Python Script: The script that reads from the CSV, processes the data, and displays visual and statistical outputs.

## Output Explanation

### Visual Outputs
1. Scatter Plot: This plot visualizes all the data points with cloud_ids_cnt on the x-axis and time on the y-axis. Points are colored differently based on whether the request failed or succeeded (if applicable).
2. Trend Line: A red line on the scatter plot which indicates the predicted linear trend based on linear regression analysis.

### Statistical Outputs
1. Correlation Coefficient (r): This value ranges from -1 to 1. It measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the number of parameters and the execution time.
   - 1 or -1 indicates a perfect linear relationship.
   - **0** indicates no linear correlation.
   - Values closer to 1** or -1** suggest a stronger linear relationship.
2. Slope: This is the slope of the trend line. A positive slope indicates that as the number of parameters increases, the execution time also increases. Conversely, a negative slope indicates the opposite.
3. Intercept: This is where the trend line crosses the y-axis. It represents the expected execution time when the number of parameters is zero.
4. R-squared: This value explains the percentage of the variance in the execution time that is predictable from the number of parameters.
   - Closer to **1** means a high proportion of variance in execution time is predictable from the parameters count.
5. P-value: This assesses the significance of the results. A p-value less than 0.05 typically indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, suggesting that the correlation observed is statistically significant.

## How to Interpret These Results
- High correlation coefficient and small p-value: Significant evidence of a strong linear relationship.
- R-squared value: Gives an idea about how much of the variation in execution time can be explained by the number of parameters.
- Analyze the scatter plot and trend line visually to understand the distribution and alignment of data points around the fitted line. It provides a visual sense of how well the model fits the data.

## Conclusions
By running this script and analyzing both the visual and statistical outputs, you can make data-driven decisions about system optimizations or predict future behavior based on parameters count. This understanding can help in planning and improving request handling processes based on their complexity (parameters count) and expected execution times.
